- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @maakkiiii
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in reading, boxing and basketball. I love a good fantasybook.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in the military, so not really doing any programming.
- ðŸ“« Reaching me is pretty easy, my instagram username is @maakkii___ or use my email: markovic.mateja@hotmail.com 
-  Don't really know why anyone would want to reach me. Except if the wanna talk about books. Ohh I could go on for hours about the first Percy Jackson book only.
-  So I don't really think anyone is going to read this, but if you do, I appreciate you checking out my profile.
-  Although it was probably pretty boring, I gotta say I worked hard on that Snake game.
