- 👋 Hi, I’m @maakkiiii
- 👀 I’m interested in reading, boxing and basketball. I know reading looks kinda weird next to the other two. Still love me a good fantasybook.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying computer science and preparing for my internship. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate a lot with my bed, by sleeping.
- 📫 Reaching me is pretty easy, my instagram username is @maakkii___ or use my email: markovic.mateja@hotmail.com 
-  Don't really know why anyone would want to reach me. Except if the wanna talk about books. Ohh I could go on for hours about the first Percy Jackson book only.
-  So I don't really think anyone is going to read this, but if you do, I appreciate you checking out my profile.
-  Although it was probably pretty boring, I gotta say I worked hard on that Snake game.
